## Findings

### ‚úÖ Positive Findings

1. **Document Upload Successful:** Rent roll PDF was successfully uploaded to MinIO
2. **File Accessible:** Document is retrievable and readable
3. **Storage Standardized:** File is stored in the correct standardized path
4. **Metadata Captured:** Document year, period, and property information properly extracted

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

2. **Property ID Mismatch:** Rent roll uploaded to property ID 7, but database shows Hammond Aire as property ID 3
3. **Scale Mismatch:** Actual property is much larger than database indicates
4. **Data Not Synchronized:** Rent roll data has not been parsed and loaded into the database

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Replace Sample Data:** Update database with actual tenant and occupancy information from the rent roll
2. **Correct Property Records:**
   - Update property size to reflect actual 349,660 sq ft
   - Update unit count to reflect actual number of leasable units
   - Update tenant names with actual tenants
3. **Implement Rent Roll Parser:** Create automated parser to extract tenant data from rent roll PDFs
4. **Data Validation:** Establish process to validate uploaded documents against database records

### Long-Term Improvements

2. **Data Reconciliation:** Monthly reconciliation process between uploaded documents and database
3. **Validation Alerts:** Alert users when uploaded documents show significant discrepancies
