# ✅ MinIO Persistent Storage - COMPLETE

**Time:** October 13, 2025 12:09 PM  
**Status:** All MinIO buckets created and persistence verified

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Created All MinIO Buckets ✅
- `reims-files` - Backend document storage
- `reims-documents` - Primary uploads  
- `reims-financial` - Financial documents
- `reims-property-photos` - Property images
- `reims-processed` - AI-processed data
- `reims-archives` - Historical storage
- `reims-backups` - System backups
- `reims-temp` - Temporary files
- `reims-reports` - Generated reports

### 2. Verified Docker Volume Persistence ✅
```
Volume: reims_minio_data
Status: Active and persistent
Location: /var/lib/docker/volumes/reims_minio_data/_data
```

### 3. Tested Upload & Persistence ✅
- Uploaded test files to 3 buckets
- Verified files persist in MinIO console
- Confirmed data survives container restarts

---

## 📋 Current System Status

### ✅ Running Services
- Docker: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Ollama, Prometheus, Grafana, Nginx, pgAdmin, **RQ Worker**
- Backend: http://localhost:8001 (SQLite mode)
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001

### ⚠️ Current Issue

**Database has 29 documents, but MinIO buckets are empty (except test files)**

This means:
- Old file metadata exists in database
- Actual files were lost when MinIO was reset
- Worker tried to process 29 jobs but all failed with "File not found"

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Option 1: Re-upload ESP Files (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to frontend: http://localhost:3001
2. Navigate to Upload page
3. Upload the 3 ESP files again:
   - ESP 2024 Income Statement.pdf
   - ESP 2024 Cash Flow Statement.pdf
   - ESP 2024 Balance Sheet.pdf
4. Files will be stored in MinIO permanently
5. Worker will automatically process them

### Option 2: Clear Old Data & Start Fresh
```bash
# Clear database tables
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('reims.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('DELETE FROM financial_documents')
cursor.execute('DELETE FROM processing_jobs')
cursor.execute('DELETE FROM extracted_data')
conn.commit()
conn.close()
print('✅ Database cleared')
"

# Then re-upload files from frontend
```

## 📊 MinIO Access

**MinIO Console:** http://localhost:9001
- **Username:** minioadmin  
- **Password:** minioadmin

You can now:
- View all buckets
- Browse uploaded files
- See file persistence working

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check MinIO Buckets
```bash
python verify_minio_complete.py
```

### Check Database Status
```bash
python check_queue_status.py
```

### Watch Worker Logs
```bash
docker logs reims-worker --follow
```

### Re-create All Buckets (if needed)
```bash
python setup_minio_buckets.py
```

## ✨ What's Fixed

1. ✅ **MinIO buckets now persist** across container restarts
2. ✅ **Docker volume configured** for permanent storage  
3. ✅ **All 9 buckets created** and tested
4. ✅ **RQ Worker running** in Docker container
5. ✅ **Backend and Frontend** both running
6. ✅ **Redis queue operational**

---

## 🎯 What's Next

To complete the file processing workflow:

1. **Re-upload ESP files** from frontend → Files saved to MinIO
2. **Worker processes files** → Data extracted to `extracted_data` table
3. **Frontend displays data** → KPIs, charts, dashboards show real data

## 📁 Created Files

- `MINIO_PERSISTENCE_COMPLETE.md` - Full documentation
- `setup_minio_buckets.py` - Bucket creation script
- `create_reims_files_bucket.py` - Creates reims-files bucket
- `verify_minio_complete.py` - Persistence verification
- `check_queue_status.py` - Queue and database status checker
- `enqueue_documents.py` - Manual document queue management

---

## ✅ Verification Results

```
✅ MinIO Connected
✅ 9 Buckets Created
✅ Persistence Verified
✅ Test Files Uploaded
✅ Docker Volume Active
✅ Worker Running
✅ Backend Running
✅ Frontend Running
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **MINIO PERSISTENCE COMPLETE**

You can now upload files through the frontend and they will be permanently stored in MinIO!
