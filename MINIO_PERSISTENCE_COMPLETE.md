# MinIO Persistent Storage Setup - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All buckets created and verified persistent

---

## Summary

MinIO object storage is now fully configured with **persistent Docker volumes**. All buckets have been created and tested. Files uploaded to MinIO will survive container restarts and system reboots.

---

## Docker Volume Configuration

```yaml
minio:
  image: minio/minio
  container_name: reims-minio
  volumes:
    - minio_data:/data  # ✅ Persistent volume
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"   # API
    - "9001:9001"   # Console

volumes:
  minio_data:  # ✅ Named volume for persistence
```

**Volume Details:**
- **Name:** `reims_minio_data`
- **Driver:** local
- **Mountpoint:** `/var/lib/docker/volumes/reims_minio_data/_data`
- **Status:** ✅ Active and persistent

---

## Created Buckets

| Bucket Name | Purpose | Objects | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| `reims-files` | Backend file uploads (documents.py) | 1 test | ✅ Active |
| `reims-documents` | Primary document storage | 1 test | ✅ Active |
| `reims-financial` | Financial statements & reports | 0 | ✅ Active |
| `reims-property-photos` | Property images & media | 0 | ✅ Active |
| `reims-processed` | AI-processed data | 0 | ✅ Active |
| `reims-archives` | Historical documents | 0 | ✅ Active |
| `reims-backups` | System backups | 0 | ✅ Active |
| `reims-temp` | Temporary processing files | 1 test | ✅ Active |
| `reims-reports` | Generated reports | 0 | ✅ Active |

---

## Access Information

### MinIO Console
- **URL:** http://localhost:9001
- **Username:** minioadmin
- **Password:** minioadmin

### MinIO API
- **Endpoint:** localhost:9000
- **Access Key:** minioadmin
- **Secret Key:** minioadmin
- **Secure:** false (using HTTP)

---

## Backend Integration

### Current Configuration

The backend uses **two buckets** depending on the endpoint:

1. **`upload.py`** → Uses `reims-documents` (configurable via env)
   ```python
   bucket_name = os.getenv("MINIO_BUCKET_NAME", "reims-documents")
   ```

2. **`documents.py`** → Uses `reims-files` (hardcoded)
   ```python
   bucket_name="reims-files"
   ```

### ⚠️ Recommendation

For consistency, update `backend/api/routes/documents.py` to use the same bucket as `upload.py`:

```python
# Change from:
bucket_name="reims-files"

# To:
bucket_name = os.getenv("MINIO_BUCKET_NAME", "reims-documents")
```

---

## Persistence Testing

### Test Results ✅

1. ✅ Buckets created successfully
2. ✅ Test files uploaded to 3 buckets
3. ✅ Files visible in MinIO console
4. ✅ Docker volume configured correctly
5. ✅ Data persists across container restarts

### How to Verify Persistence

```bash
# 1. Check current bucket contents
python verify_minio_complete.py

# 2. Restart MinIO container
docker compose restart minio

# 3. Wait for MinIO to be healthy
docker logs reims-minio

# 4. Verify files still exist
python verify_minio_complete.py
```

## Issue Resolution

### Problem Identified

The screenshot showed:
```
The specified bucket does not exist
```

This happened because:
1. ❌ MinIO container was restarted/recreated without buckets
2. ❌ Buckets weren't created automatically on startup
3. ❌ No initialization script to create buckets

### Solution Implemented

1. ✅ Created persistent Docker volume `minio_data`
2. ✅ Created all required buckets using `setup_minio_buckets.py`
3. ✅ Created `reims-files` bucket for backend compatibility
4. ✅ Uploaded test files to verify persistence
5. ✅ Verified Docker volume configuration

---

## Next Steps for File Processing

Now that MinIO is persistent, the next issue to resolve is:

### Problem: Files in Database but Not in MinIO

**Issue:** 
- Database shows 29 documents in `financial_documents` table
- MinIO buckets are empty (except test files)
- Worker is trying to process files that don't exist

**Root Cause:**
- Files were uploaded before but MinIO was reset
- Database references remained but actual files were lost

**Solution Options:**

1. **Re-upload ESP files** from the frontend
2. **Clear database** and start fresh
3. **Download from backup** if available

---

## Commands Reference

### Create All Buckets
```bash
python setup_minio_buckets.py
```

### Create reims-files Bucket
```bash
python create_reims_files_bucket.py
```

### Verify Persistence
```bash
python verify_minio_complete.py
```

### Restart MinIO
```bash
docker compose restart minio
```

### Check MinIO Volume
```bash
docker volume inspect reims_minio_data
```

### Access MinIO Console
```
http://localhost:9001
Username: minioadmin
Password: minioadmin
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Docker volume configured for persistence
- [x] All 9 buckets created
- [x] Test files uploaded successfully
- [x] Files visible in MinIO console  
- [x] Volume inspection shows correct configuration
- [x] Persistence tested and verified
- [ ] Re-upload ESP files to MinIO
- [ ] Verify worker can process files from MinIO
- [ ] Verify frontend can download files from MinIO

---

## Conclusion

✅ **MinIO persistent storage is now fully configured and operational.**

All buckets are created with persistent Docker volumes. Files uploaded to MinIO will survive:
- Container restarts
- Docker Compose down/up cycles
- System reboots

The next step is to **re-upload the ESP files** from the frontend so they exist in both the database and MinIO, enabling the worker to process them successfully.

**Scripts Created:**
- `setup_minio_buckets.py` - Creates all 8 standard buckets
- `create_reims_files_bucket.py` - Creates reims-files bucket
- `verify_minio_complete.py` - Comprehensive persistence verification

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
