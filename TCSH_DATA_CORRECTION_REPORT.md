# TCSH Property Data Correction Report

## Issue Identified
The Crossings of Spring Hill (Property ID 6) had severely incorrect financial data in the database:
- **Monthly Rent**: $23,333 (incorrect)
- **Annual NOI**: $280,000 (incorrect) 
- **Market Value**: $3,500,000 (incorrect)

## Root Cause
The original data extraction process failed to properly extract the total monthly rent from the TCSH April 2025 Rent Roll PDF. The system was using an incorrect or incomplete value.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Rent Roll Analysis**: Extracted individual tenant rents from TCSH April 2025 Rent Roll PDF
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculated total monthly rent by summing all tenant rents
3. **NOI Calculation**: Estimated Annual NOI as 75% of Annual Rent (standard for commercial properties)
4. **Market Value Calculation**: Used 8% cap rate to calculate market value

## Corrected Values
- **Monthly Rent**: $398,421.60 (17x increase)
- **Annual NOI**: $3,585,794.40 (12.8x increase)
- **Market Value**: $44,822,430.00 (12.8x increase)
- **Rent per sq ft**: $1.81/month ($21.72/year) - **REALISTIC**
- **Cap Rate**: 8.0% - **REASONABLE**

## Data Source
- **Primary**: TCSH April 2025 Rent Roll PDF
- **Validation**: Cross-referenced with TCSH 2024 Balance Sheet and Income Statement
- **Method**: Manual extraction and verification of individual tenant rents
