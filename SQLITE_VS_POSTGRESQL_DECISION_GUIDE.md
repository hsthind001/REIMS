# SQLite vs PostgreSQL - Decision Guide for REIMS

## 🎯 TL;DR - Quick Answer

**Can you use ONLY SQLite?**
- ✅ **YES** - For development, testing, and **small-scale production** (1-10 users)
- ❌ **NO** - For large-scale production (50+ concurrent users)

**Do you need BOTH databases?**
- ❌ **NO** - You only need ONE database, not both
- Choose based on your scale and requirements

## 📊 Detailed Analysis

### Option 1: Use ONLY SQLite

#### ✅ When SQLite is PERFECT for REIMS

**Use SQLite if:**
- Single user or small team (1-10 people)
- Development and testing
- Prototype/demo environment
- Limited budget (no server costs)
- Simple deployment (just copy the file)
- Desktop application
- Internal company tool
- Low-moderate data volume (<100GB)

**Your Current Situation:**
```
Users: Small team
Data: 28 documents, 127 properties
Traffic: Low-moderate
Status: ✅ SQLite is working PERFECTLY!
```

#### ✅ Advantages of SQLite for REIMS

1. **Zero Configuration**
   ```python
   # That's it! No server, no setup
   DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./reims.db"
   ```

2. **No Server Required**
   - No PostgreSQL service to manage
   - No Docker container needed
   - No network configuration
   - No authentication issues

3. **Simple Deployment**
   ```powershell
   # Backup entire database
   copy reims.db reims_backup.db
   
   # Restore database
   copy reims_backup.db reims.db
   
   # That's it!
   ```

4. **Fast for Your Scale**
   - Single-user read: < 1ms
   - Small queries: Very fast
   - File operations: Direct access

5. **Portable**
   ```
   Move REIMS to new computer?
   → Just copy reims.db file
   → Done!
   ```

6. **Cost Effective**
   - No database server license
   - No hosting costs
   - Minimal resource usage

#### ❌ Limitations of SQLite for REIMS

1. **Concurrent Writes Limited**
   ```
   Users writing simultaneously:
   1-5 users:   ✅ Fine
   10-20 users: ⚠️  Occasional locks
   50+ users:   ❌ Serious problems
   ```

2. **No Built-in Replication**
   - Can't automatically sync to backup server
   - Manual backup required
   - No automatic failover

3. **Single Server Only**
   - Can't distribute across multiple servers
   - Can't scale horizontally

4. **Limited Concurrent Connections**
   ```python
   # SQLite limitation
   Max concurrent writers: 1
   Max concurrent readers: Unlimited
   
   Problem: If 10 users upload files simultaneously,
            they queue up (slower)
   ```

5. **File Locking Issues**
   ```
   Scenario: 2 users upload at same time
   
   User 1: Writing to database... ✅
   User 2: Waiting for lock... ⏳
   
   If User 1 is slow: User 2 gets timeout error
   ```

### Option 2: Use ONLY PostgreSQL

#### ✅ When PostgreSQL is NECESSARY for REIMS

**Use PostgreSQL if:**
- Multiple concurrent users (50+)
- Production deployment
- Need high availability (99.9% uptime)
- Large data volume (>100GB)
- Need data replication
- Require advanced security
- Need audit trails
- Multiple applications accessing same data

#### ✅ Advantages of PostgreSQL for REIMS

1. **Handles Many Concurrent Users**
   ```
   Concurrent operations:
   100 users uploading:     ✅ No problem
   1000 users querying:     ✅ Scales well
   Complex analytics:       ✅ Optimized
   ```

2. **Enterprise Features**
   ```sql
   -- Row-level security
   CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON documents
   FOR ALL TO app_user
   USING (tenant_id = current_user_tenant());
   
   -- Full-text search
   SELECT * FROM documents 
   WHERE to_tsvector('english', content) @@ to_tsquery('real estate');
   
   -- Advanced analytics
   SELECT 
       property_id,
       COUNT(*) as total_docs,
       AVG(file_size) OVER (PARTITION BY property_type) as avg_size
   FROM financial_documents
   WHERE upload_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
   ```

3. **Built-in Replication**
   ```
   Primary Server (writes) → Replica 1 (reads)
                          → Replica 2 (reads)
                          → Backup Server
   
   If primary fails → Automatic failover to replica
   ```

4. **Better Performance at Scale**
   ```
   Database size:
   1 GB:      SQLite ≈ PostgreSQL
   10 GB:     SQLite < PostgreSQL
   100 GB:    SQLite << PostgreSQL
   1 TB:      SQLite = impossible, PostgreSQL = ✅
   ```

5. **Connection Pooling**
   ```python
   # PostgreSQL can maintain 100 connections
   pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
       min_size=10,   # Always 10 ready
       max_size=100   # Scale to 100 if needed
   )
   ```

6. **Advanced Security**
   - Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
   - Row-level security policies
   - Advanced user permissions
   - Audit logging
   - Data encryption at rest

#### ❌ Disadvantages of PostgreSQL for REIMS

1. **Complex Setup**
   ```yaml
   # Need Docker or server installation
   # Need configuration
   # Need network setup
   # Need user management
   # Need backup strategy
   ```

2. **Resource Intensive**
   ```
   PostgreSQL Memory Usage:
   Minimum: 256 MB RAM
   Recommended: 1-4 GB RAM
   
   SQLite Memory Usage:
   Minimum: 1 MB RAM
   Typical: 10-50 MB RAM
   ```

3. **Requires Maintenance**
   - Vacuum database regularly
   - Analyze query performance
   - Monitor connections
   - Update statistics
   - Backup management

4. **Network Dependency**
   ```
   SQLite:      Direct file access (fast)
   PostgreSQL:  Network round-trip (slower for local)
   ```

---

### Option 3: Use BOTH Databases (Dual Database)

#### ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**

**Why you DON'T need both:**

1. **Unnecessary Complexity**
   ```
   Managing two databases:
   - 2x backup strategies
   - 2x monitoring systems
   - 2x connection logic
   - Data sync issues
   - Which is source of truth?
   ```

2. **Data Consistency Problems**
   ```
   Upload goes to PostgreSQL ✅
   But query checks SQLite ❌
   
   Result: User sees "file not found"
   Actual: File exists, wrong database!
   ```

3. **No Real Benefits**
   - Use PostgreSQL if you need scale
   - Use SQLite if you don't
   - Never need both simultaneously

**Only Exception:**
- Using SQLite for **local cache** while PostgreSQL is primary
- But this is advanced and usually unnecessary

## 🔧 Migration Path

### Starting with SQLite → Moving to PostgreSQL Later

**Good News:** Easy to migrate!

```python
# Migration script
import sqlite3
import psycopg2

# Connect to both
sqlite_conn = sqlite3.connect('reims.db')
pg_conn = psycopg2.connect('postgresql://postgres:dev123@localhost:5432/reims')

# Migrate data
sqlite_cursor = sqlite_conn.cursor()
pg_cursor = pg_conn.cursor()

# Get all documents from SQLite
docs = sqlite_cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM financial_documents').fetchall()

# Insert into PostgreSQL
for doc in docs:
    pg_cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO financial_documents (id, file_name, property_id, ...)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, ...)
    """, doc)

pg_conn.commit()
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Fix PostgreSQL connection (already done!)
2. Run migration script
3. Update `.env` to use PostgreSQL
4. Restart backend
5. Done! (Takes 5-10 minutes)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For YOUR Current Situation (REIMS Application)

**Based on what we know:**
- Small team
- 28 documents currently
- Development/internal use
- SQLite is working perfectly

**My Recommendation:**

### 🟢 **Keep Using SQLite** (for now)

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ It's already working perfectly
2. ✅ Simple, no server management
3. ✅ Adequate for your current scale
4. ✅ Easy backups (just copy file)
5. ✅ No configuration headaches
6. ✅ Free (no hosting costs)

**When to Switch to PostgreSQL:**
- When you have 20+ concurrent users
- When database size > 10 GB
- When you need 99.9% uptime
- When you launch to external clients
- When compliance requires audit logs

**How to Monitor When You Need to Switch:**
```python
# Add this to your backend
import time

@app.middleware("http")
async def measure_db_performance(request, call_next):
    start = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    duration = time.time() - start
    
    if duration > 1.0:  # Slow response
        print(f"WARNING: Slow database query: {duration}s")
        # If you see many of these → time to switch to PostgreSQL
    
    return response
```
